                    <figcaption><span>Depth-first search (DFS)</span> is an algorithm for traversing a tree. It starts traversing from the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. Usually uses <span>stack</span> to find the shortest path. In geeral, DFS is faster than BFS.<br><span>Time complexity: </span> O(V+E)</figcaption>

                    <figcaption><span>Breadth-first search (BFS)</span> is an algorithm for searching a tree. It starts traversing from the root node and explores all nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. Extra memory, usually a <span>queue</span>, is needed to keep track of the child nodes that were encountered but not yet explored. It is usually a better option when target is closer to source.<br> <span>Time complexity: O(V+E)</span></figcaption>
